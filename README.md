# RandomNums_Python

One of my earliest programs, in fact I try to code this type of algorithms each time I learn a new language to experience all the challenges there are while coding it.

This algorithm challenges a user to guess a random number from 1 to 100, given a limited number of guesses. 

I tried to make it look the best possible as a printed output game. I added colors and made the code run without any possible bugs, all possibilities have been taken care of.

## How to run

To get started you can `git clone  https://github.com/DYasser/RandomNums_Python.git` and have `Python3` installed. When you have `Python3` installed you can run the file easily either by double clicking or by running it from an IDE.
